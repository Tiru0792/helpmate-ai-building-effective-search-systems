The GitHub repository includes a document titled Building Effective Search Systems which outlines the components necessary for developing a functional and efficient search system. The project emphasizes key aspects such as:

System Design Workflow: Proper implementation of design workflows with effective coding practices.
Document Parsing and Chunking: Handling PDF documents with appropriate chunking strategies and storing the chunks.
Semantic Search and Embeddings: Performing embeddings using at least two different models and storing them in a Chroma collection.
Search Optimization: Implementing mechanisms like caching and re-ranking with cross-encoders.
Result Retrieval: Extracting top results and creating quality, relevant prompts.
Generative Layer: Developing a generative layer to enhance search result quality.
Documentation: Providing comprehensive project documentation, supported by screenshots.
